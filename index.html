        <h1>Privacy Policy for Bprod</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 27, 2025 </p>
        
        <p>Thank you for using Bprod - Be Productive ("the extension"). Your privacy is our top priority. This policy explains what information the extension handles and, more importantly, what it *doesn't* do.</p>
        
        <p class="notice">Our guiding philosophy is simple: <strong>Your data is your own. It never leaves your computer.</strong></p>

        <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Bprod is designed to be your personal productivity partner. To provide its features, the extension handles two types of data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Productivity Data:</strong> When you start a Pomodoro timer, the extension logs the website domain you are currently viewing (e.g., "google.com") and the amount of time spent there. This tracking <strong>only</strong> occurs when the timer is actively running. This data is used to populate your "Domain Breakdown" and calendar heatmap.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Entered Data:</strong> This includes the to-do list items you voluntarily add for each day ("Today's Tasks") and your personal settings for "Daily Goal" and "Pomodoro Time".</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>
        <p>All information handled by Bprod (your domain history, task lists, and settings) is stored <strong>locally on your computer</strong> using the built-in <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API.</p>
        
        <p><strong>We do not have a server.</strong> Your data is <strong>never</strong> sent to any external server, analytics service, or database. We (the developers of Bprod) <strong>do not have access to your data.</strong> It stays entirely within your own Chrome browser.</p>

        <h2>How Your Data is Used</h2>
        <p>Your data is used <em>only</em> for the following features, which are visible <em>only</em> to you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To display your "Total / Goal" and "vs Yesterday" stats.</li>
            <li>To show your list of "Today's Tasks" in the popup and dashboard.</li>
            <li>To render your productivity history in the "Domain Breakdown" list.</li>
            <li>To populate the monthly calendar heatmap with your daily totals.</li>
            <li>To generate a <code>.csv</code> file on your computer *only when you* click one of the "Export" buttons. This file is created on your device and is not sent anywhere.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade your data with any third parties. Period. Since your data is only on your computer, we have no data to share.</p>

        <h2>Your Control Over Your Data</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete individual domain entries for the current day from the "Domain Breakdown" card in the dashboard.</li>
            <li>You can delete individual tasks from the "Tasks" list in the popup or dashboard.</li>
            <li>You can delete <strong>all</strong> of your stored data at any time by clicking the <strong>"Clear All Data"</strong> button in the dashboard's "Export / Import" section. This action is irreversible and permanently deletes your history from your computer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and/or on the extension's Chrome Web Store listing.</p>
